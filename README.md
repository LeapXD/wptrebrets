Add data from TREB to WordPress

This plugin will download listings based on the MLS numbers you add to Settings -> WPTREBS Settings. It will download the properties and add them as a post type as well as the images and store them on your server.

Once a day it will run a check to see if it needs to update to the latest version of the listing or remove the listing if it doesn't exist.

To install it just upload the plugin into your plugins folder and add the MLS numbers to your settings. It will automatically be run in a day.

No support is offered with this plugin but if you have any questions please email me at moe@loubani.com, I'm also available for full real estate site solutions.

Usage: use the post types as you would any other post. The custom fields are visible if you check the custom fields box at the top.

Use shortcode [wptrebs_feed number="4"] to get a feed of properties, you can pass a number to retrieve or leave it out to get the default 4.

Version 0.1:

First release, use at your own risk.


To do:
